#OpenCL caffe

This is an OpenCL implementation of one of the main stream DNN framework-CAFFE, see more details about CAFFE below.  The goal is to provide the community an OpenCL version of DNN framework to use. Things are not perfect yet. We will keep adding new features and improving performance. We also hope to get help from community to improve it together.

OpenCL is an open standard parallel programming language that is supported by more than 20 companies. People can use this framework to run their DNN app on heterogeneous platforms from vairous commercial chip manufacturer. Compared to CUDA based DNN, this framework support cross-platform compatability and with design space to optimize accordingly.

#Design features
  -All layers ported to OpenCL
  
  -Aligned with caffeâ€™s latest code

  -Performance improvement by batched sgemm implementation for conv layer

  -User can choose optimal batch number depending on H/W, image size and minibatch size

  -Supports OpenCL 2.0, 1.2
  
  -only contains C++ and OpenCL, maintains the same interfaces as original caffe to make it easy for caffe users

  -Users can directly run DNN models: AlexNet, VGG 16 and VGG-19

Note: More featurs will be added in the near future. And this OpenCL caffe only verifies on AMD devices (CPUs/GPUs/APUs). Compatibility across different chip manufacturers will be considered to add if there is a need.

#Performance

We will keep updating the latest performance we could achieve in this section.

* Training speed (Model: AlexNet, minibatch size 128)

    -AMD W9100 (5.2TFLOPS), 255 images per second

    -AMD R9 Fury((7.2TFLOPS)), 261 images per second

* Recognition speed (Model: AlexNet, minibatch size 128)

    -AMD W9100 (5.2TFLOPS), 590 images per second

    -AMD R9 Fury((7.2TFLOPS)), 699 images per second

# Original Caffe information
## Caffe

Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.
It is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center ([BVLC](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu)) and community contributors.
